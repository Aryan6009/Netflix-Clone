# 💫 About Me:
I’m a 3rd-year B.Tech Computer Science student with a deep passion for mobile and web development, currently focusing on building full-stack applications using Flutter for front-end and Flask for backend. I believe technology should be not just powerful, but also user-friendly, accessible, and secure.

While I haven’t formally studied cybersecurity or earned certifications, I’m highly curious and actively learning through hands-on development projects, exploring how to build better, more secure digital systems from the ground up. My interest in security comes from a practical developer’s mindset — knowing that a good app is not just about features but also about trust and protection.

I’m always eager to improve my skills by collaborating on real-world projects, learning from experienced developers, and contributing wherever I can. Whether it's refining code, experimenting with new tools, or understanding deployment challenges — I approach every challenge as a chance to grow.

I'm not just aiming to build apps. I want to build meaningful, reliable experiences that people can trust and enjoy.
